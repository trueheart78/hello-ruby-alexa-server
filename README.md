# Basic Server Response for Alexa Requests

Default setup is a response from the `Faker` gem to respond with a TV-level
hacker statement.

Used the [alexa_rubykit gem][alexa_rubykit] and referenced the
[TaskRabbit "Developing an Amazon Alexa Skill on Rails" post][taskrabbit] by
Brian Leonard.

## Running the Server

It is designed to be run with `Shotgun`, to enable code reloading
without having to restart the server.

```
bundle exec shotgun
```

You can also run it via basic Ruby.

```
bundle exec ruby server.rb
```

## Simple Access via Ngrok

[Ngrok][ngrok] allows access via tunnelling, so that you can interact with the
Sinatra server without having to go through the hassle of deploying it everytime
you make a change.

To access the `Shotgun` server, use:

```
ngrok http 9393
```

If you just want to access the basic Sinatra server, use:

```
ngrok http 4567
```


## Alexa Skill Intent

When working with this application, the following are recommended starting intents
for the Alexa skill:

* `AMAZON.YesIntent`
* `AMAZON.HelpIntent`
* `AMAZON.CancelIntent`
* `AMAZON.StopIntent`
